# Type of password reset 
## Email-Based Reset
The goal is to send a reset link by email, then the system generate another password or the user can choose his new password.
## Security Question-Based Reset
The system ask a question based on personnal information. This can be bypassed by finding this personnal information.
## SMS-Based Reset
Similar to the email based reset, it suppose that the phone is safe, this type of password reset is vulnerable to **SIM swapping**.

# Vulnerability
- **Predictable tokens**: If the token respect a sequential pattern, we can guess it or brute-force their way to generate valid reset URLs.
- **Token Expiration Issues**: If a token do not expire when it is used, it offer a window of opportunity.
- **Insufficient Validation**: If the question or the information asked are to common, we can exploit it.
- **Divulgation d'informations**: Too much verbosity in the error can help attacker during the enumeration phase.
- **Transport non sécurisé**: If the website is not in HTTPS, a spy in the network can get the token because it is not encrypted.
