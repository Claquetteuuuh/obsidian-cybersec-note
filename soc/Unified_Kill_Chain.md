# Threat Modelling
It is a series of steps to improve the security of a system.
To **identify the risk** you can:
- **Identify the systems and applications that have to be secured** and their usage in the environment.
- Assessing **what vulnerabilities and weaknesses** these systems and applications may have and how it could be exploited
- Create a **plan of action to secure** these systems
- Putting in **policies** to prevent these vulnerabilities from occuring again

**STRIDE**, **DREAD** and **CVSS** are all frameworks specifically used in threat modelling.

# Phase: Through (Network Propagation)

# Phase: out (Action on Objectives)
This phase is when the attacker have critical asset access.
It can be detailled in 4 parts:
- **Collection**: The attacker will search to get every sensitive data.
- **Exfiltration**: It consist in steal the data
- **Impact**: The objective of the attacker is to disturb the process
- **Objectives**: If it's financials reason, the adversary will try to ask for a ransom
