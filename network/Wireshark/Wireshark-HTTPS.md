## 1. HTTPS Protocol Overview
### Key Characteristics
- Encrypted web communication protocol
- Uses TLS (Transport Layer Security)
- Protects against:
    - Spoofing
    - Sniffing
    - Traffic interception
### Encryption Challenges

- Encrypted packets appear in different colors
- Protocol details hidden
- URL addresses and server data obscured
## 2. Wireshark HTTPS Filtering Techniques
### Basic HTTPS Filters

```
# Global filters
http.request      # HTTP requests
tls               # TLS protocol
ssdp              # Service discovery protocol

# TLS Handshake Filters
# Client Hello
(http.request or tls.handshake.type == 1) and !(ssdp)

# Server Hello
(http.request or tls.handshake.type == 2) and !(ssdp)
```
### Specific TLS Handshake Filters

```
# TLS Client Request
tls.handshake.type == 1

# TLS Server Response
tls.handshake.type == 2
```
## 3. SSL/TLS Key Log File Generation
### Key Generation Process

- Unique key pairs created per session
- Specific browser configuration required
- Supported Browsers:
    - Google Chrome
    - Mozilla Firefox
### Environment Setup

1. Set environment variable
2. Create SSLKEYLOGFILE
3. Capture keys during web browsing
## 4. Adding Key Log Files in Wireshark
### Two Primary Methods

1. Right-click menu
    - Direct file addition
2. Preferences menu
    - `Edit --> Preferences --> Protocols --> TLS`
## 5. Decryption Process
### Decryption Requirements

- Capture traffic during active session
- Generate key log file simultaneously
- Apply key log file to Wireshark
### Visible Data After Decryption

- Packet details
- Decrypted TLS information
- Decompressed headers
- Reassembled TCP streams
- HTTP2 packet details
## 6. Investigation Techniques
### Packet Analysis Approaches

- Examine multiple data formats
- Compare encrypted vs. decrypted views
- Analyze packet layers thoroughly
- Look for anomalous communication patterns
## 7. Advanced Decryption Strategies
### Comprehensive Analysis Workflow

1. Capture full network traffic
2. Generate SSL/TLS key log file
3. Apply key log file to Wireshark
4. Analyze decrypted communication
5. Identify potential security risks
## 8. Challenges in HTTPS Decryption
### Potential Limitations

- Session-specific key generation
- Performance overhead
- Privacy considerations
- Complex setup process
## 9. Ethical and Legal Considerations
### Important Guidelines

- Obtain proper authorization
- Respect privacy regulations
- Use decryption techniques responsibly
- Maintain strict confidentiality
## 10. Mitigation Strategies
### Recommended Practices

1. Implement robust encryption
2. Regularly update TLS configurations
3. Monitor key management processes
4. Develop comprehensive security policies
