# Security
## Base network Security Control levels

| **Physical**       | Physical security controls **prevent unauthorised physical access** to networking devices, cable boards, **locks**, and all linked components.              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical**      | Data security controls prevent **unauthorised access to network data**, like **installing tunnels** and implementing security layers.                       |
| **Administrative** | Administrative security controls **provide consistency** in security operations like **creating policies**, **access levels** and authentication processes. |
## The main approach
| **Access Control**                                                                                              | **Threat Control**                                                                                                                                    |

| The starting point of Network Security. It is a set of controls to **ensure authentication and authorisation**. | **Detecting and preventing** anomalous/**malicious activities** on the network. It contains both internal (trusted) and external traffic data probes. |
## The key elements of Access Control
| **Firewall Protection  <br>**            | Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic with predetermined security rules. Designed to block suspicious/malicious traffic and application-layer threats while allowing legitimate and expected traffic.                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Access Control (NAC)**         | **Controls the devices**' suitability **before access to the network**. Designed to verify device specifications and conditions are compliant with the predetermined profile before connecting to the network.                |
| **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | Controls and manages the **asset identities** and **user access to data systems** and resources over the network.                                                                                                             |
| **Load Balancing**                       | Controls the **resource usage** to distribute (based on **metrics**) tasks over a set of resources and improve overall data processing flow.                                                                                  |
| **Network Segmentation  <br>**           | Creates and controls network ranges and segmentation to **isolate** the users' access levels, group assets with common functionalities, and improve the **protection of sensitive/internal devices/data in a safer network**. |
| **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)  <br>** | Creates and controls **encrypted communication** between devices (typically for secure remote access) over the network (including communications over the internet).                                                          |
| **Zero Trust Model**                     | Suggests configuring and implementing the access and permissions at a minimum level (providing access required to fulfil the assigned role). The mindset is focused on: "**Never trust, always verify**".                     |
## The key elements of Threat control
| **[[IDS-IPS]] Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)  <br>** | Inspects the traffic and **creates alerts (IDS)** or **resets the connection (IPS)** when detecting an anomaly/threat.                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)  <br>**                               | Inspects the traffic (performs content inspection and contextual analysis of the data on the wire) and **blocks the extraction of sensitive data**.                                                                                                                               |
| **Endpoint Protection  <br>**                                      | **Protecting all kinds of endpoints** and appliances that connect to the network by using a multi-layered approach like **encryption**, **antivirus**, **antimalware**, **DLP**, and IDS/IPS.                                                                                     |
| **Cloud Security**                                                 | **Protecting cloud/online-based** systems resources from threats and **data leakage** by applying suitable countermeasures like **VPN and data encryption**.                                                                                                                      |
| **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  <br>**         | Technology that **helps threat detection**, **compliance**, and **security incident management**, through available data (logs and traffic statistics) by using event and **context analysis to identify anomalies**, threats, and vulnerabilities.                               |
| **Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR)  <br>**    | Technology that helps **coordinate and automates** tasks between **various** people, **tools**, and **data** within a single platform to identify anomalies, threats, and vulnerabilities. It also supports vulnerability management, incident response, and security operations. |
| **Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response**      | **Inspecting network traffic** or traffic capture to **identify anomalies** and threats.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
