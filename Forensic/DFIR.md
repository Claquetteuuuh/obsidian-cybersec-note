Digital Forensics and Incident Response covers the collection of forensic artifacts from digital device such as computers, media devices, and smartphones to investigate an incident.
It identify footprints left by an attacker.

DFIR helps security professionals in various ways, some of which are summarized below:

- Finding evidence of attacker activity in the network and sifting false alarms from actual incidents.
- Robustly removing the attacker,  so their foothold from the network no longer remains.
- Identifying the extent and timeframe of a breach. This helps in communicating with relevant stakeholders.
- Finding the loopholes that led to the breach. What needs to be changed to avoid the breach in the future?
- Understanding attacker behavior to pre-emptively block further intrusion attempts by the attacker.
- Sharing information about the attacker with the community.
