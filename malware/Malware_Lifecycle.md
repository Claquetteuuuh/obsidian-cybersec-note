## 1. Delivery
This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.
## 2. Execution
Here's the **main part of how we classify Malware**. What does it actually do? If it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.

**We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important - and is what we'll be covering.**
## 3. Maintaining Persistence
Imagine a keylogger has been installed, but you then restart your Computer 30 seconds later. Unless you've entered a lot of sensitive information in 30 seconds - that'll be of no use to the author.
## 4. Persistence
This stage is largely why Malware is so **"noisy"**, Malware employs many techniques. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the "execution" is worth its while.
## 5. Propagation
If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it? Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.
**In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:**
### Host-Based Signatures
These are generally speaking the results of execution and any persistence performed by the Malware. For example, has a file been encrypted? 
### Network-Based Signatures
In this classification of signatures are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation. For example, in Ransomware, where has the Malware contacted for Bitcoin payments?
