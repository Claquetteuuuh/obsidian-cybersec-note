# Targeted
A "Targeted" attack is just that - **targeted**. In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target.

A famous exemple is Stuxnet, a malware used in Iran.
# Mass Campaign
On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks. The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to **infect as many devices as possible** and perform whatever it may - **regardless of target**.
