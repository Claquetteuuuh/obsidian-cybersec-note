It is an important skill to have in these industries:
- **Security Operations**: teams analyze malware to write detections for malicious activity in their networks.
- **Incident Response**: teams analyze malware to determine what damage has been done to an environment to remediate and revert that damage.
- **Threat Hunt**: teams analyze malware to identify IOCs, which they use to hunt for malware in a network.
- **Malware Researchers**: in security product vendor teams analyze malware to add detections for them in their security products.
- **Threat Research**: teams in OS Vendors like Microsoft and Google analyze malware to discover the vulnerabilities exploited and add more security features to the OS/applications.
# Important Rules
- **Never analyze malware** or suspected malware on a **machine that does not have the sole purpose** of analyzing malware.
- When not analyzing or moving malware samples around to different locations, **always keep them in password-protected zip/rar** or other archives so that we can avoid accidental detonation.
- **Only** extract the malware **from this password-protected archive** inside the isolated environment, and only when analyzing it.
- **Create an isolated VM** specifically for malware analysis, which has the capability of being reverted to a clean slate once you are done.
- Ensure that **all internet connections are closed** or at least monitored.
- Once you are done with malware analysis, **revert the VM to its clean slate for the next malware analysis session** to avoid residue from a previous malware execution corrupting the next one.
# Type of analysis
## Static Analysis
This is when the malware is analysed **without being executed**.
In this case, the different properties of the PE file are analyzed without running it.
Similarly in the case of malicious document we can explore the document's properties.

Exemple:
- **Checking strings** 
- **Checking headers**
- **Looking at the code** using a disassemble

Malware avade these type of analysis using obfuscation, packing, or other means of hiding its properties.
## Dynamic Analysis
The dilemma of a malware is that **it have to be executed** to fulfil its purpose, it becomes an **easy target** for **detection once it runs**.

In this case of analysis we have to run the malware in a **controlled environment** to observe what it does in these cases.
It include **running the malware in a VM**, either in a manual fashion with tools installed to monitor the malware's activity or in the form of sandboxes that perform this task automatically.

Once we run the malware we can use our knowledge in **Windows Forensics** to identify what it did in our environment.
## Advanced Malware Analysis
These are techniques are used to analyze malware that evades basic static and dynamic analysis.
In this type of analysis we use debuggers and disassemblers. A debbugger allows the analyst to stop and run the malware at different points to identify interesting pieces of information.
